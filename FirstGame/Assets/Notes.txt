 Notes: 

    Debug.Log() or print() :  No difference
    
    Time.delta : To control differences in fps, calculates on seconds instead of frames
    
    FixedUpdate:
        Intervals between frames are same
        Used for physics: adjusting Rigidbody objects
    
    Layers and Tags for labeling objects (attributes): lock layers, call tag attribute

    Edit --> Snap settings : Control how objects relate to grid --> Ctrl (Similar to pixel placement PS)

    To add smooth movement: ForceMode.VelocityChange, drag (more airresistence, slows down faster)

    For better visuals: Window --> Rendering --> Lighting settings --> Fog 
        Distant obstacles not visible

    Shortcuts:
        Shift + space : Maximize game view
        Ctrl + d : Duplicate objects
        Ctrl + p : Run
